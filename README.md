<b>Problem Statement</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Supplies for essential services in ‘Containment Zones’</b>
<br><ul>
<li>With the COVID-19 crisis, we have already seen problems with the local supply of grocery items, medicines and other supplies during lock-down especially for elderly and other vulnerable people. Especially when an area gets defined as ‘Containment Zone’ the situation becomes more challenging for people in absence of right resources or platform to avail these services as people are not allowed to go outside to avail even essential services.</li>

<li>The restrictions imposed by local authorities, the recommended (or required) self-isolation and social distancing measures can compound the problem by preventing people from easily getting to locations with the best stocks of local supplies.</li>

<li>The Volunteers working in local communities are not usually updated with who needs what, where ? They may have will to help and provide voluntary services to people but generally lack the platform which can assist them in effective collaborative way of service.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Preliminary Assistance & Quick Reporting for suspected Covid-19 cases in an area</b>
<br><ul>
<li>Another challenge people face is about getting preliminary medical advice/support in case if someone is showing mild to moderate or few of the Covid -19 related symptoms. The helpline numbers are usually flooded and its not advisable to show up/visit nearby hospital in this situation unless its not really a confirmed/suspected case.</li>

<li>RRT team members/ health workers working in field who have been asked to do door to door surveys for identifying cases and providing guidance in such scenarios can help here. But people are struggling to contact right individuals (health workers, Medical Supervisors) working in given area, get right advice, local information related to testing or precautionary measures in general on their own.</li>

<li>The limited resources (RRT members/staff, tools) sometimes delay the data collection via door to door surveys and reporting which can delay further decision making such as (zone declarations, imposing certain restrictions or medical support availability)</li>

<li>Not everyone is having quick access to Map views identifying zones with covid-19 cases in given locality</li>
</ul>
